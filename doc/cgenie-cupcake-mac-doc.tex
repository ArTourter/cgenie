\begin{document}

\maketitle

These instructions have been tested on Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10) but should
work on Mavericks (10.9) as well. However we recommend that you use the latest
version of the OS available as we may not be able to reproduce errors and bugs
you may report.

The following instructions will require you to use the Mac OS X Terminal
application. This can be opened by using the \keys{\cmd+\SPACE} key combination
and searching for `\textit{Terminal}', alternatively it can be found in the
\directory{Macintosh HD/Applications/Utilities} directory. We suggest you pin
the application to your Dock for easy access if you haven't done so already.

\section{System Requirements}

To install and run cGENIE on Mac OS X you will need the following packages
installed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Apple Xcode
	\item Xcode Command line Tools
	\item the MacPorts environment
	\item the HomeBrew packaging system 
	\item python
%	\item scons
	\item gfortran compiler 
	\item wget
	\item NetCDF libraries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Apple Xcode}

Apple Xcode can be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store. More details
can be found at \url{https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/}. XCode
contains the GNU C Compiler (\texttt{gcc}) and most of the other libraries and
tools to allow the compilation of the model.

In addition to Xcode, you will need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.
These used to be installed by default on older versions of Xcode but are now
distributed separately. Once Xcode is installed, you will need to run the
following command in the terminal:
%You can find instructions on installing this at
%\url{http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html}\,\footnote{Future
%versions of this document will reproduce these instructions in case the link
%disapear}.

\begin{minted}{console}
$ xcode-select --install
\end{minted} 

You can check if Xcode is properly installed using the command:

\mint{console}|$ xcode-select -p|
which should contain the following line in the response:
\begin{minted}{console}
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
\end{minted}

While we are checking the environment, you can check that \texttt{gcc} is installed properly:

\begin{minted}{console}
$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.49) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0
Thread model: posix
\end{minted}

\subsection{Homebrew \& MacPorts}

Homebrew is a package manager for OS X which allows users to download and
install packages found in other UNIX style environment such as Linux and keep
them up to date in a managed way in the sense that one can update packages and
manage dependencies. MacPort has a similar aim but with a slightly different
philosophy. We will not compare these two here as it goes beyond the scope of
this document but we have used both to install software required to run cGENIE
on the Mac.

Homebrew and information about it can be found at \url{http://brew.sh/}. To
install the environment, simply type the following line in the Terminal:

\mint{console}|$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"|

MacPort and information about it can be found at
\url{https://www.macports.org/} and instructions on how to install it are found
at \url{https://www.macports.org/install.php}. Following the installation, you
should make sure your installation is fully up to date by running:

\mint{console}|$ sudo port -v selfupdate|

\subsection{Python}

The install scripts for cGENIE are written in \texttt{python} and require version
2.7.9. Mac OS X comes with \texttt{python} installed by default since version 10.8
(Mountain Lion) but it is not the correct version (Yosemite comes with version
2.7.6). You will therefore need to install an other version of \texttt{python}. The
homebrew package is the correct version so we suggest you install this one.

\mint{console}|$ brew install python|

To check which version of \texttt{python} you are running:

\begin{minted}{console}
$ python -V
Python 2.7.9
\end{minted}

%\subsection{SCons}
%
%\texttt{SCons} is a software construction tools built in \texttt{python} which role and
%functionality is similar to the \texttt{autotool}\slash \texttt{automake} and
%\texttt{make} tool chain. cGENIE Cupcake does not use \texttt{make} any more and is built
%on \texttt{SCons} instead.
%
%As with previous tools, we will use the package provided by Homebrew:
%
%\mint{console}|$ brew install scons|
%
%You can then test your installations with:
%
%\begin{minted}{console}
%$ scons --version
%SCons by Steven Knight et al.:
%	script: v2.3.4, 2014/09/27 12:51:43, by garyo on lubuntu
%	engine: v2.3.4, 2014/09/27 12:51:43, by garyo on lubuntu
%	engine path: ['/usr/local/Cellar/scons/2.3.4/libexec/scons-local/SCons']
%Copyright (c) 2001 - 2014 The SCons Foundation
%\end{minted}

\subsection{Fortran Compiler (\texttt{gfortran})}

We will get \texttt{gfortran} from homebrew. This is simply done by using the command:

\mint{console}|$ brew install gfortran|

it will download and install all the dependencies as well as the request
software itself. At the time of writing, the version of \texttt{gfortran}
available on the brew servers is 4.9.2.  

You can check that \texttt{gfortran} is properly installed by issuing the command:

\begin{minted}{console}
$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (Homebrew gcc 4.9.2_1) 4.9.2
Copyright (C) 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

GNU Fortran comes with NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
You may redistribute copies of GNU Fortran
under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
For more information about these matters, see the file named COPYING
\end{minted}

\subsection{wget}

\texttt{wget} is a command line tool to download files hosted online. It is
used by cGENIE install scripts to fetch files it requires. This programme is
available as a Homebrew package:

\mint{console}|$ brew install wget|

\subsection{NetCDF Libraries}

For NetCDF we will use the version available from MacPorts (we have tried using
Homebrew for this in order to minimise the requirements and not mix the
packaging environment but unfortunately, the NetCDF brew package could not be
installed on our test machine. If this changes, we will reevaluate our
instructions.

Although previous versions of cGENIE required the C, C++ and fortran versions
of the library, this is no longer the case and the C++ layer is not a
requirement anymore. The following commands  will install the necessary NetCDF
libraries:

\begin{minted}{console}
$ sudo port install netcdf
$ sudo port install netcdf-fortran
\end{minted}

\section{Installing and running cGENIE (cupcake)}

With all the steps described in this document, you should be able to follow the
instructions described in the
\href{run:./cupcake-config-build.pdf}{\texttt{cupcake-config-build.pdf}} file in this
folder to install and run the model.

If you have any issues with running cGENIE (cupcake) on Mac OS X, please report them at
\url{https://github.com/genie-model/cgenie/issues}.

\section{Quirks}

Because so much of the system depends on third party repositories, it may not
always behave as expected. We are aware that MacPorts for example provide
packages for most of the tools we get from Hombrew, however, we have had
reports of failures on systems with MacPorts packages where installing the
Homebrew package was a solution. This is especially valid for python.

We realised that making users change there tool chains is very much a
annoyance. We are trying to test multiple install setup and try to understand
why one tool chain fails where the other doesn't, but we currently lack the
resources to do so quickly.

The information in this document is valid at the time of writing with the
version of packages available at that time. Since we do not control the
packages distributed on either Homebrew or MacPorts, we cannot tell whether
updated versions of these packages will still work. We will endeavour to follow
the releases of the packages with use and test any upgrade but it is not
guaranteed happen in a timely manner. The main victim of that is python, the
version of which is currently hardcoded in the code and is required to be
2.7.9.
